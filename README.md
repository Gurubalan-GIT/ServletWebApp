# Servlet Web Application
This is a web application using Java as a server language through servlets and JSP.

## IDE 
- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. 
For more insight, download [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

## Tomcat server
The entire web application is wrapped inside a `Tomcat server`. Visit here for the official [documentation](http://tomcat.apache.org/).

## MySQL Server
Apache servers of `XAMPP` are used for this along with `PhpMyAdmin`. Visit [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) for more information.

## Servlets
This is a Java class which extends HttpServlet and hence uses HTTP Protocols such as GET and POST methods through doGet and doPost methods. 
We override these methods from the HttpServlet class and hence get the values from the Front-end components (HTML Components which are embedded
inside JSP in this case.) and store them in the Servlet class through the HttpServletRequest object reference. For more information [Read here](https://www.javatpoint.com/servlet-tutorial).
